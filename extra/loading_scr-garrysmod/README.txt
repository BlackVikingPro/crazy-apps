Hello, World.

Garry's Mod Tweaks! by: BlackVikingPro

~~~ Loading Screen ~~~
Let's mod Garry's Mod! The loading screen specifically...
So, first. Open the File Explorer... Go to (if Steam and GMod is in default dir) "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\html".
Find "loading.html"...
Once found, back this one up by copying the file, and paste it in the same dir. Call the backup "loading-backup.html".
Then, delete "loading.html", and replace that file with the one you just downloaded! Enjoy :D
