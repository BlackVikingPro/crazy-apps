#**Crazy Apps**
###By: *BlackVikingPro*

##About
**Crazy Apps** is just a small group of some executables that I've aquired over
the years. I code these myself, and are usually meant for Windows.

No, I can't really code in Bash, because I've no reason to (I don't have a *nix system)

##What do these do?
Well, they can do a number of things, though they are very simple, and are extremely
easy to code. So, whether or not you are a **"1337"** coder or programmer, you should
catch the jist of the code being used here.

##Do you have community support?
Well sure I do, just add some stuff in the [WiKi](https://github.com/BlackVikingPro/crazy-apps/wiki), or you can [Fork me!](https://github.com/BlackVikingPro/crazy-apps/fork)

##How or Where can I learn these?
Well, I am a self-teacher for the most part. That's how I am 16, and can code all types of languages.
One of the most useful resources I used to my advantage to build these is a website called [SS64](http://ss64.com/).
